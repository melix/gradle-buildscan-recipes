This plugin enhances the information published in https://scans.gradle.com[Build Scans] with custom values and tags.

This https://scans.gradle.com/s/wjgfuwn447g2o[sample Build Scan] was generated using this plugin, for example, on Travis CI.
This https://scans.gradle.com/s/sburrg2uho64k[other one] was generated locally, using this plugin too: you will notice
that it is marked as `dirty` and shows the git status.

== Configuration

The plugin provides a number of _recipes_ that can be used to automatically add tags and custom values to Build Scans.
The following recipes are available:

* `git-commit`          : Tries to determine the Git commit ID for the build
* `git-status`          : Outputs the result of `git status`, and tags the build as `dirty` if there are uncommitted or changes files locally
* `git-diff-to-gist`    : Pushes the result of `git diff` to a Gist and creates a link in the build scan to this diff
* `gitlab-ci`           : Detects a build running under https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/README.html[GitLab CI], tags it as `CI` and outputs information about GitLab CI environment
* `teamcity`            : Detects a build running under https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/[TeamCity], tags it as `CI`, and adds a link to the build
* `travis-ci`           : Detects a build running under https://travis-ci.org[Travis CI], tags it as `CI` and outputs information about the Travis environment
* `disk-usage`          : Shows information about Gradle disk usage. It will scan your `$HOME/.gradle` directory as well as your project directory. Note that depending on your disk type, OS, disk usage and file system, this can turn to be very slow and add a non negligeable time at build start. You should therefore use this recipe with care. This recipe only works on Linux and Mac OS.
* `gc-stats`            : Shows statistics about garbage collection happening during your build.
* `gist`                : Allows to use a recipe found in a GitHub Gist
* `remote`              : Allows to use a recipe found in any remote URL
* `file-leak-detection` : Attemps to identify tasks which leak file handles (experimental)

=== Recipe specific parameters

==== `git-commit`

The `git-commit` recipe accepts an optional `baseUrl` parameter. If specified, a link to the commit will also be created. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
buildScanRecipes {
    recipe 'git-commit', baseUrl: 'https://github.com/melix/gradle-buildscan-recipes/tree'
}
----

==== `git-diff-to-gist`

This recipe will take the result of the `git diff` command and paste it as a Gist. By default, this will create a private
Gist, but still be aware than anyone with the link can view the diff. For this recipe to work, you need a GitHub account
 and an https://github.com/settings/tokens[API Token]. We *strongly* recommend that you create a token specifically for
  this recipe, limited to the `gist` access rights. The recipe takes 3 optional parameters:

* `user` is your GitHub username
* `token` is your API token. If not specified explicitly, will look for a project property named "gistToken"
* `public` (by default `"false"`) tells if the Gist should be public (`"true"`) or private (`"false"`).

All those arguments are optional. For security reasons, we recommend not setting the `user` and `token` directly in your
build file. For this reason, the recipe will by default search for a project property `gistUsername` for the username
and `gistToken` for the token. You can set those properties in your home directory `gradle.properties` file:

.~/gradle.properties
```
gistUsername=buildscansrulez
gistToken=github-generated-api-token
```

If you do this, the simples configuration looks like this:

```
buildScanRecipes {
   ...
   recipes 'git-diff-to-gist'
}
```

In addition, if you don't want to systematically publish the diff, you can run with `-PnoGist`:

```
./gradlew -PnoGist someTask
```

==== `teamcity`

The `teamcity` recipe accepts 2 optional parameters:

* `baseUrl` needs to be set to the CI server base URL
* `guest`, if set, will generate a URL with anonymous login

==== `file-leak-detection`

This recipe will attempt to detect which tasks leak file handles (a leaking file handle is often referred to a file which is open
but never closed). If a file is opened during a build, but never closed, subsequent builds may fail, dependending on your operating
system, because of those. Typically, your build could fail removing a jar file because the previous build opened it, but never closed
it. This is problematic in Gradle if you use the daemon, which is now on by default. So it is important to track which tasks
do not properly close their files, so that you can either report to the plugin author (for tasks defined in a plugin) or fix your
build.

The recipe works by loading http://file-leak-detector.kohsuke.org/[a Java agent] that will track file handles. If leaking files
are detected, the build scan will report a `LEAKING FILE HANDLES` tag, and in custom values you will see each file that leaks a
file, with the files and details as to where it happens (for debugging).

For example, imagine the following build file:

[source,groovy]
----
task foo1 {
   doLast {
      def fos = file('/tmp/foo1.txt').newOutputStream()
   }
}

task foo2 {
   doLast {
      def fos = file('/tmp/foo2.txt').newOutputStream()
      fos.close()
   }
}
----

The `foo1` task is opening a file, but never closes it. The `foo2` task, on the contrary, closes it properly. Here's the
resulting https://scans.gradle.com/s/dpvxomrln43bo/custom-values[build scan]. The details file contains the stack trace to
the file open, so you could see:

```
...snip...
	at build_733t8o56jehucx5ms8s6ul86j$_run_closure6$_closure11.doCall(/home/cchampeau/DEV/PROJECTS/GITHUB/buildscan-recipes-plugin/test/build.gradle:67)
	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
...snip...

```

And therefore find out where the file is opened and never closed.

This recipe is still experimental, as it could potentially detect files opened by Gradle, which are closed _after_ a build is finished.

If the recipe is applied, it is still possible to avoid loading the agent and paying the overhead of detection by using `-PdisableLeakDetection`.

=== External recipes

In addition to the bundled recipes, it is possible to use recipes on external resources. The first recipe allows to
reference another recipe found in a GitHub Gist:

==== `gist`

```
buildScanRecipes {
   recipe 'gist', user: 'melix',
                  id: '5944cb701d6c9650ecaccccd4642ea5f',
                  rev: '4b40b45559929ee2baaa7599e29dd78e51c3843a',
                  recipe: 'my-recipe',
                  // external recipe parameters
                  name: 'Bob'
}
```

The `gist` recipe accepts the following parameters:

- `user`: username of the gist owner
- `id` id of the gist
- `recipe` name of the file containing the gist
- `rev` revision of the gist. If absent, the compiled recipe will not be cached.

Any additional parameter will be passed to the remote recipe (here, the `name` parameter).

If the `rev` parameter is present, we're pointing at
a specific version of the Gist, so the recipe will fetch it only once, compile it and cache it in the
`$USER_HOME/.gradle/buildScanRecipes` directory. If it is absent, it is going to point to `HEAD`, meaning that
each time the recipe is called, it's going to fetch it remotely, compile it, but it will *not* cache the result.

==== `remote`

As an alternative to the `gist` recipe, you can simply reference any remote URL, using the `remote` recipe:

```
   recipe 'remote',
          url: 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/melix/5944cb701d6c9650ecaccccd4642ea5f/raw//my-recipe.groovy',
          cache: 'true',
          // external recipe parameters below:
          name: 'Bob'
```

This recipe will fetch the remote recipe, compile it, and cache it if and only if the `cache` flag is set to `true`. The
recipe accepts 2 parameters:

* `url` : the URL of the script, pointing at a Groovy recipe script
* `cache` : if `true`, the URL will only be fetched the first time, then it will compile the script and subsequent
executions will reuse the result, avoiding a network call and compile phase.

Any additional parameter will be passed to the remote recipe (here, the `name` parameter).

It's worth noting that this recipe can be used to compile local recipes too, or to test recipes before you publish
them on a Gist or anywhere else:

```
buildScanRecipes {
   recipe 'remote',
          url: file('recipes/my-awesome-recipe.groovy').toURL(),
          // local recipe parameters below
          name: 'Bob'
}
```

== Adding recipes

Recipes are written in Groovy and can be found in the https://github.com/melix/gradle-buildscan-recipes/tree/master/src/recipes[recipes] directory. Note that the rules are _statically compiled_ and expose 2 variables:

* `buildScan`, of type `BuildScanExtension`, providing ability to tag a build scan, add a link, or add custom values
* `gradle`, giving access to the `Gradle` instance of the build
* `params`, a `Map<String, String>` of parameters (non-null, but maybe empty)

Recipes are bundled with this plugin.
