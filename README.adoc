This plugin enhances the information published in https://scans.gradle.com[Build Scans] with custom values and tags.

This https://scans.gradle.com/s/wjgfuwn447g2o[sample Build Scan] was generated using this plugin, for example, on Travis CI.
This https://scans.gradle.com/s/sburrg2uho64k[other one] was generated locally, using this plugin too: you will notice
that it is marked as `dirty` and shows the git status.

== Usage

== Configuration

The plugin provides a number of _recipes_ that can be used to automatically add tags and custom values to Build Scans.
The following recipes are available:

* `git-branch`       : Tries to determine the Git branch name for the build
* `git-commit`       : Tries to determine the Git commit ID for the build
* `git-status`       : Outputs the result of `git status`, and tags the build as `dirty` if there are uncommitted or changes files locally
* `git-diff-to-gist` : Pushes the result of `git diff` to a Gist and creates a link in the build scan to this diff
* `teamcity`         : Detects a build running under https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/[TeamCity], tags it as `CI`, and adds a link to the build
* `travis-ci`        : Detects a build running under https://travis-ci.org[Travis CI], tags it as `CI` and outputs information about the Travis environment
* `disk-usage`       : Shows information about Gradle disk usage. It will scan your `$HOME/.gradle` directory as well as your project directory. Note that depending on your disk type, OS, disk usage and file system, this can turn to be very slow and add a non negligeable time at build start. You should therefore use this recipe with care. This recipe only works on Linux and Mac OS.
* `gc-stats`         : Shows statistics about garbage collection happening during your build.
* `gist`             : Allows to use a recipe found in a GitHub Gist
* `remote`           : Allows to use a recipe found in any remote URL

=== Recipe specific parameters

==== `git-commit`

The `git-commit` recipe accepts an optional `baseUrl` parameter. If specified, a link to the commit will also be created. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
buildScan {
    recipe 'git-commit', baseUrl: 'https://github.com/melix/gradle-buildscan-recipes/tree'
}
----

==== `git-diff-to-gist`

This recipe will take the result of the `git diff` command and paste it as a Gist. By default, this will create a private
Gist, but still be aware than anyone with the link can view the diff. For this recipe to work, you need a GitHub account
 and an https://github.com/settings/tokens[API Token]. We *strongly* recommend that you create a token specifically for
  this recipe, limited to the `gist` access rights. The recipe takes 3 optional parameters:

* `user` is your GitHub username
* `token` is your API token. If not specified explicitly, will look for a project property named "gistToken"
* `public` (by default `"false"`) tells if the Gist should be public (`"true"`) or private (`"false"`).

All those arguments are optional. For security reasons, we recommend not setting the `user` and `token` directly in your
build file. For this reason, the recipe will by default search for a project property `gistUsername` for the username
and `gistToken` for the token. You can set those properties in your home directory `gradle.properties` file:

.~/gradle.properties
```
gistUsername=buildscansrulez
gistToken=github-generated-api-token
```

If you do this, the simples configuration looks like this:

```
buildScan {
   ...
   recipes 'git-diff-to-gist'
}
```

In addition, if you don't want to systematically publish the diff, you can run with `-PnoGist`:

```
./gradlew -PnoGist someTask
```

==== `teamcity`

The `teamcity` recipe accepts 2 optional parameters:

* `baseUrl` needs to be set to the CI server base URL
* `guest`, if set, will generate a URL with anonymous login

==== `messages`

The `messages` recipe allows adding values, tags and links by convention. Any project property which starts with `buildScanValue` will be converted to a value. A property
 starting with `buildScanTag` will be converted to a tag, and `buildScanLink` into a link. For example:

* `gradle -PbuildScanValueMessage="Hello, World!"` will add a build scan value `Message` with value `Hello, World!`
* `gradle -PbuildScanTagHELLO will tag the build scan with `HELLO`
* `gradle -PbuildScanLinkGradle="https://www.gradle.org"` will add a link named `Gradle` pointing to `https://www.gradle.org`

=== External recipes

In addition to the bundled recipes, it is possible to use recipes on external resources. The first recipe allows to
reference another recipe found in a GitHub Gist:

==== `gist`

```
buildScan {
   recipe 'gist', user: 'melix',
                  id: '5944cb701d6c9650ecaccccd4642ea5f',
                  rev: '4b40b45559929ee2baaa7599e29dd78e51c3843a',
                  recipe: 'my-recipe',
                  // external recipe parameters
                  name: 'Bob'
}
```

The `gist` recipe accepts the following parameters:

- `user`: username of the gist owner
- `id` id of the gist
- `recipe` name of the file containing the gist
- `rev` revision of the gist. If absent, the compiled recipe will not be cached.

Any additional parameter will be passed to the remote recipe (here, the `name` parameter).

If the `rev` parameter is present, we're pointing at
a specific version of the Gist, so the recipe will fetch it only once, compile it and cache it in the
`$USER_HOME/.gradle/buildScanRecipes` directory. If it is absent, it is going to point to `HEAD`, meaning that
each time the recipe is called, it's going to fetch it remotely, compile it, but it will *not* cache the result.

==== `remote`

As an alternative to the `gist` recipe, you can simply reference any remote URL, using the `remote` recipe:

```
   recipe 'remote',
          url: 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/melix/5944cb701d6c9650ecaccccd4642ea5f/raw//my-recipe.groovy',
          cache: 'true',
          // external recipe parameters below:
          name: 'Bob'
```

This recipe will fetch the remote recipe, compile it, and cache it if and only if the `cache` flag is set to `true`. The
recipe accepts 2 parameters:

* `url` : the URL of the script, pointing at a Groovy recipe script
* `cache` : if `true`, the URL will only be fetched the first time, then it will compile the script and subsequent
executions will reuse the result, avoiding a network call and compile phase.

Any additional parameter will be passed to the remote recipe (here, the `name` parameter).

It's worth noting that this recipe can be used to compile local recipes too, or to test recipes before you publish
them on a Gist or anywhere else:

```
buildScan {
   recipe 'remote',
          url: file('recipes/my-awesome-recipe.groovy').toURL(),
          // local recipe parameters below
          name: 'Bob'
}
```

== Adding recipes

Recipes are written in Groovy and can be found in the https://github.com/melix/gradle-buildscan-recipes/tree/master/src/recipes[recipes] directory. Note that the rules are _statically compiled_ and expose 2 variables:

* `buildScan`, of type `BuildScanExtension`, providing ability to tag a build scan, add a link, or add custom values
* `gradle`, giving access to the `Gradle` instance of the build
* `params`, a `Map<String, String>` of parameters (non-null, but maybe empty)

Recipes are bundled with this plugin.
